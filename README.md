# HipGISAXS-DESY-2022
Repository containing the code developed during DESY 2022 summer student program.

This project focused on the development of real space models of cellulose nanofibril (CNF) and silver nanowire (AgNW) films and simulating GISAXS scattering patterns from this data, using HipGISAXS-2.0. The code found here covers the data collection from blender, the simulation code from hipGISAXS-2.0., automation code to be ran locally or remotely (Maxwell @ DESY ) and various analysis codes that I developed as well.
